I've now been a (self taught) Scrum Master for 3 years, and I'm currently going through the certification course to get to Certified Scrum Master status.
The teams I've been working with were of max 6 people and they were cross-functional. We've been working on a big project for about 18 months followed by smaller projects of about 3 months each.
During this time I've made lots of mistakes and learnt lots of things about Scrum/Agile Methodologies, team dynamics and project delivery, and I also asked myself some questions:

 - [Is Scrum Master a full time job?](#fulltime)
 - [What does a Scrum Master do on a day to day basis?](#daytoday)
 - [Is he/she a leader?](#leader)
 - [Should he/she have a technical background?](#techy)
 - [Experience over Certification?](#cert)

I've seen that this was a hot topic at the end of 2011 and people have pretty strong views about the subject.

In my experience, I was both Scrum Master and Developer, and I have to say that I struggled to cover both roles at the same time. A Scrum Master is prone to interruptions from other team members, product owner and sometimes stake holders. This means constant context switching which has been proven to be counterproductive.
A Scrum Master is also in charge of all scrum ceremonies which can take time to prepare, for example retrospectives and backlog grooming. They take time because you want to make them more efficient, so you study and prepare new techniques and you read previous meetings notes.
Add to that the fact that he/she needs to be on alert for impediments to the team, and to remove them he/she needs to enbark long meetings with upper management, or sometimes particular problems take up a lot of time.

What I can see could work, and is already the reality for most Scrum Masters, is that a Scrum Master looks after multiple teams. In that case you are completely focused on the Scrum processes and I believe you'll become much more effective.

# <a id="daytoday">What does a Scrum Master do on a day to day basis?</a>
This was a question I asked myself while learning about Scrum. Again, based on my experience a Scrum Master makes sure that all the ceremonies happen, are focused and time bounded, he/she removes impediment, but more than anything else he/she observes the team, the team's data, he/she supports the product owner and he/she reasearches ways to improve the overall processes. He/she is also in constant contact with the Product Owner to discuss future releases and/or other issues that can impact the development of the product.

It maybe sounds like easy stuff, but believe me it's not. Making sure that the backlog is in an estimable state for the next iteration is not easy and it is time consuming.

# <a id="leader">Is he/she a leader?</a>
He/she definetly is a leader, of the Scrum processes. We should not confuse the Scrum Master with a technical leader.

# <a id="techy">Should he/she have a technical background?</a>
Not necessarily. Sometimes is good, so that he/she can explain team decisions to the Product Owner without involving anybody from the team, but other times it could be dangerous, for example if the Scrum Master makes decisions on implementation or estimates stories without consulting the team.

# <a id="cert">Experience over Certification?</a>
On the net you can find a lot of discussions on the subject. I was the first to be skeptical about certification, or better about how certification was/is granted. I do not believe that a 2 day course can certify that someone understands and can apply the full Scrum framework for a team. (to be clear, Scrum Alliance and Scrum.org consider the first level exam as the Scrum base knowledge)
I think that the course can really help you getting started with Scrum, but then only experience on the field can give you the insights and the confidence to use the full potential of the Scrum Framework.
That said, Scrum Alliance and Scrum.org are putting a lot of effort in creating tests and other level of certifications which can actually be really good. For example to obtain the Certified Scrum Professional through Scrum Alliance you will need to prove that you've successfully applied Scrum for a minimum of three years and you will also need to show that you keep yourself up to date by participating to workshops, conferences and meetups.
As a fairly new discipline I think Scrum will need to go through these rough phases of standardisation and regulation, but I also think they are on the right path.
