I've been now a (self taught) Scrum Master for 3 years, and I'm currently going through the certification course to get to Certified Scrum Master status.
The teams I've been working with were of max 6 people and they were cross-functional. We've been working on a big project for about 18 months followed by smaller projects of about 3 months each.
During this time I've made lots of mistakes and learnt lots of things about Scrum/Agile Methodologies, team dynamics and project delivery, but I still don't have final answers for the following questions:

 - Is Scrum Master a full time job?
 - What does a Scrum Master do on a day to day basis?
 - Is he/she a leader?
 - Should he/she have a technical background?
 - Experience over Certification?
 - Is Product Ownership the next logical step up for a Scrum Master?

# Is Scrum Master a full time job?
I've seen that this was a hot topic at the end of 2011 and people have pretty strong views about the subject.

In my experience, I was both Scrum Master and Developer, and I have to say that I struggled to cover both roles at the same time. A Scrum Master is prone to interruptions from other team members, product owner and sometimes stake holders. This means constant context switching which has been proven to be counterproductive.
A Scrum Master is also in charge of all scrum ceremonies which can take time to prepare, for example retrospectives, backlog grooming or analysis, etc. They take time because you want to make them more efficient, so you study and prepare new techniques and you read previous meetings notes.
Add to that the fact that he/she needs to be on alert for impediments to the team, and to remove them he/she needs to enbark long meetings with upper management, or endless phone calls to solve a problem.
I know that the Scrum guide suggests to timebox all the Scrum ceremonies but, from personal experience, it's really difficult. Sometimes you are in the zone and you want to take advantage of that. Maybe I should try and apply the pomodoro technique for backlog estimation and grooming.

So personal experience tells me that, at least at the beginnig, a Scrum Master should be a full time job, and a Scrum Master should be the agile processes expert for the project/product.

# What does a Scrum Master do on a day to day basis?
This was a question I asked myself while learning about Scrum. Again, based on my experience a Scrum Master makes sure that all the ceremonies happen, are focused and time bounded, he/she removes impediment, but more that anything else he observes the team, the team's data, he/she supports the product owner and he/she reasearches ways to improve the overall processes.

It maybe sounds like easy stuff, but believe me it's not. Making sure that the backlog is in an estimable state for he next iteration is not easy and time consuming.

# Is he/she a leader?
He/she definetly is a leader, for the overall processes. We should not confuse the Scrum master with a technical leader.

# Should he/she have a technical background?
Not necessarily. Sometimes is good, so that he/she can explain team decisions to the Product Owner without involving anybody from the team, but other times it could be dangerous.
Again, from experience, I've noticed that more than once I used my Scrum Master Leader status to force a decision on implementation
