I've been now a (self taught) Scrum Master for 3 years, and I'm currently going through the certification course to get to Certified Scrum Master status.
The teams I've been working with were of max 6 people and they were  cross-functional. We've been working on a big project for about 18 months followed by smaller projects of about 3 months each.
During this time I've made lots of mistakes and learnt lots of things about Scrum/Agile Methodologies, team dynamics and project delivery, but I still don't have final answers for the following questions:

 - Is Scrum Master a full time job?
 - What does a Scrum Master do on a day to day basis?
 - Is he/she a leader?
 - Should he/she have a technical background?
 - Experience over Certification?
 - Is Product Ownership the next logical step up for a Scrum Master?

# Is Scrum Master a full time job?
I've seen that this was a hot topic at the end of 2011 and people have pretty strong views about the subject.
I asked the question to the Agile Coach at the CSM course I'm attending and the answer was that the Scrum Master role should take between 20% to 40% of a team member's overall time. He also mentioned that, when introducing scrum, an Agile Coach should be brought in, which will start the transition from the current processes to the Scrum processes, and him/her will be full time on the job. 
So why is an agile coach full time, but then a Scrum Master only 20-40%?
There could be multiple answers to the question, for example:

 - The coach will introduce and supervise the overall process, from stakeholders to PO to SM to the team.
 - the Scrum Master needs to keep the engine going.

In my experience, I was both Scrum Master and Developer, and I have to say that I struggled to cover both roles at the same time. A Scrum Master is prone to interruptions from other team members, product owner and sometimes stake holders. This means constant context switching which has been proven to be counterproductive.
A Scrum Master is also in charge of all scrum ceremonies which can take time to prepare, for example retrospectives, backlog grooming or analysis, etc.
So personal experience tells me that a Scrum Master should be a full time job, and a Scrum Master should be the agile processes expert for the project/product.
He should be seen as the owner of the processes.

# What does a Scrum Master do on a day to day basis?
This was a question I asked myself while learning about Scrum. Again, based on my experience a Scrum Master makes sure that all the ceremonies happen, are focused and time bounded, he/she removes impediment, but more that anything else he observes the team, the team's data, he/she supports the product owner and he/she reasearches ways to improve the overall processes.

It maybe sounds like easy stuff, but believe me it's not. Making sure that the backlog is in an estimable state for he next iteration is not easy and it is time consuming, removing blockers
